# Algorithm Learning Ground

Welcome to the Algorithm Learning Ground! This repository serves as a space for practicing and honing your skills in various algorithms. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just want to improve your problem-solving abilities, you'll find a collection of algorithmic challenges and solutions here.

## Contents

- **Anagrams**: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- **FizzBuzz**: Classic programming challenge to practice conditional logic.
- **Title Case**: Capitalize the first letter of each word in a string.
- **Palindrome**: Determine if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Array Chunking**: Split an array into chunks of specified size.
- **Reverse Number**: Reverse the digits of a number.
- **Max Character**: Find the most frequently occurring character in a string.
- **Vowels Count**: Count the number of vowels in a string.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate JavaScript file with test cases provided. You can run these tests to verify your understanding and observe the expected outcomes.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and explore the individual files to see how each algorithm is implemented. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-learning-ground.git
cd algorithm-learning-ground
```

Happy coding!
